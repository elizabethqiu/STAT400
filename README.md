# STAT400

These are lecture notes for Summer II 2022's STAT 400: Applied Statistics and Probability I course. Any errors are my own responsibility. I was enrolled in this course; I wrote these notes as a student. NOTE: This was an accelerated summer course; normally classes are 16 weeks but these notes were taken in a 6 week learning timeline.

Please let me know about any mistakes at elizabethjqiu@gmail.com with Subject title: "STAT 400 Error".

I gained inspo for notes from Ekesh Kumar, a former UMD CS grad and TA. I used his notes as a template for mine. He's goated.

The examples in the PDF were provided by Professor Paul J. Smith.
